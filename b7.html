            A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth It is
            believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner
            of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may
            be perceived as insincere.
